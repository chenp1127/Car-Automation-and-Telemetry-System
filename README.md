# Car-Automation-and-Telemetry-System
The task is to design a Car Automation and Telemetry System (CATS) using LPC1769 microcontroller with C embedded programming controller-based applications. The CATS work together with Recorder for Automated Telemetry (RAT), which records the data log from the car. Accelerometer is used to detect collision and deploy airbag to minimize injuries to passengers. Temperature sensor is used to measure the temperature of the battery in the electric car. Light sensor is used in REVERSE mode to simulate a radar, where the intensity increases as the obstacle is closer. CATS have three modes of operation: STATIONARY, FORWARD and REVERSE modes and will be transmitting to RAT if certain conditions are met.
